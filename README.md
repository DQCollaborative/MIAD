## DQC

The Data Quality Collaborative (DQC) is a group of leading experts working to ensure that electronic health data used for CER and PCOR is credible and high quality. The DQC has developed several papers and a research agenda to assess and report on electronic health record (EHR) data quality. The major aim of the collaboration is to develop a comprehensive data quality assessment framework and guidelines for the CER and PCOR community, including draft recommendations that can guide the development of new analytic and reporting methods specifically directed to data quality assessment and reporting.
